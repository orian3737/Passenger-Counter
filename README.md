	Hello, my name is Ryan. I am a Young Professional with a passion for coding. This is a project that I completed using Scrimbas Learn JavaScript for Free tutorial. The app is a fantastic project that showcases basic JavaScript. Using variable scoping with const, and let. Sourcing and connecting JS files onto HTML files. Building buttons using onClick, and ID variables. Retrieving said variables using .getElementById(). Then applying these IDs into a basic function, that records each click as a numerical increment and logs the variable. Then creating another function to save and display the number as a string while restoring the count function back to zero. I feel the best thing I learned during this project was the pros of using textContent vs innerText. As well as using the += function for ease of use when dealing with strings and variables. I would certainly suggest this project to other beginners. It was very easy to understand and highlighted very important syntax and JavaScript basics. Thank you,and I hope this tutorial project helps you as much as it did me. The source of this tutorial is below and is found on https://www.Srimba.com under their Free Courses.
